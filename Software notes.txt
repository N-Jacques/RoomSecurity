This file is taking notes of the specifications of my project RoomSecurity.

- application is mobile-based with IoT (will be working with a motion sensor/camera).
- motion sensor's role is to detect entry and exit of room entrances without the need for extra scanning devices like fingerprint scanners and other biometric scanning devices
- person can enter one or more rooms
- rooms can allow one or more persons authorized entry, rooms can have more than one camera
- cameras are limited to one room
